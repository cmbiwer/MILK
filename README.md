More details and tutorials can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/lanl/MILK/wiki).

Installation and requirements
=============================

MILK requires the most recent MAUD release which is currently hosted in the Dropbox MAUD folder. Python requirements are packaged in the conda environement.yml.

To install:
1. install anaconda or miniconda
2. Clone the MILK repository locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lanl/MILK.git
```

You may need to configure your git proxy for the clone to work
```
git config --global http.proxy http://myproxy:port
```

3. To install MILK locally in terminal navigate to the repository and run
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
By editing environment.yml, the name of the conda environment can be changed from the default "rietveld" to e.g. "rietveld_test" or so. For the install to complete you may need to configure your conda and your git proxy e.g. 
```
conda config --set proxy_servers.http http://myproxy:port
conda config --set proxy_servers.https https://myproxy:port
git config --global http.proxy http://myproxy:port
python -m pip config set global.proxy http://myproxy:port
```

4. To install your MAUD path and CINEMA to your conda environment run
```bash
config_maud.py /path/to/maud/application/Maud.app -c /path/to/cinema/repo
```
MILK uses the bash key $MAUD_PATH and $CINEMA_PATH unless a path is specified in the milk.json file.

In the case you are on linux or windows, you just specify the Maud folder without the .app
